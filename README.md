This app was generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) using this project template.

## Initial setup
The first thing that you must do is have Cookiecutter installed.

```bash
pip install --user cookiecutter
```

## Usage
```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/clamytoe/toepack
```
Answer the prompts or accept the defaults.

### Alternate usage
You could also clone this repo and install it from that copy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clamytoe/toepack.git
cookiecutter toepack
```

I am not adhering to them strictly, but try to clean up what's reasonable.
